- I used to design a fs here, but designing a file system now is off the point.
- what we really want is a website that stores code and allows easy collaboration.
- the storage design should be driven by the product design from the user's perspective.
- so design from the website first, and then build teh required backend for the website.
- just keep the architecture clean and agile.

ok.

- let's learn some basic react and angular.js
- step 1: build a single file compile and commmit web app
- step 2: build a single package compile and commit web app
- step 3: build a multi package compile and commit web app

- all contents served by a reverse proxy
- static contents stored in a separate directory
- dynamic contents served as a go language program
- each template has a static version, with some stub data input
